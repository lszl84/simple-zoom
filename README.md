# Deperto (Zoom by Scroll)

**Stop squinting. Your eyes will thank you.**

Ever tried to read 8px font on a 4K monitor and felt your soul leaving your body? Or maybe you just migrated from **XFCE** and your muscle memory is screaming because you can't just zoom in on a specific pixel anymore?

Nice!

## What does it do?
It brings the legendary **XFCE-style Zoom** to GNOME Shell.

- **Point** your mouse at something interesting.
- **Hold** the `Super` (Windows) key.
- **Scroll** the wheel.
- **BOOM.** Instant zoom exactly where you are looking.

It uses the native GNOME magnifier but forces it to behave like a sane tool: `proportional` tracking. That means the zoom follows your cursor, not the center of the screen.

## How to use
1. Hold the **Super** key (the one with the Windows logo).
2. **Scroll Up** to zoom in (ENHANCE!).
3. **Scroll Down** to zoom out.

### A Note on "Super + Scroll"
In standard GNOME, `Super + Scroll` might be used to switch workspaces.
**Not anymore.**
~~This extension hijacks that shortcut. We stole it. It's ours now.~~ **This isn't really the case anymore, but I'm keeping it because I like the
  humor.**

## The Shortcut Diet (The "Peace with GNOME" Update)

I realized that `Super + Scroll` is like a sacred relic in GNOME—mess with it. To keep the peace and your sanity intact, I've condensed our shortcuts into two clean, conflict-free combos:

1.  **`Super + Alt + Scroll`** (The Classic/Default): It's like a secret handshake for your fingers.
2.  **`Ctrl + Super + Scroll`** (The Power User): For those who like to use all their fingers at once.
